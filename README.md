 Bi-directional links are a straightforward way of creating an equal relationship between two or more separate Markdown files in various locations. How this is achieved is by placing a double set of square brackets around a selection of words. If the same selection of words is also in a double set of square brackets elsewhere, Obsidian knows there is a relationship between them.

When using bi-directional links, the proverbial penny dropped as this was a quite straightforward way of creating a Data Graph capable of supporting a large amount of knowledge without the need to organise a formal structure at all. Indeed, the Data Graph would grow, and the way to retrieve knowledge would be consistent no matter how large the Data Graph became.

Many tools support bi-directional links in the same or an equivalent way, and what helps Obsidian stand out is the large array of community-built plug-ins that tailor the experience, making the tool far more useful and far less time-consuming.
